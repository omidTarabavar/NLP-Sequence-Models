    "- Process features and represents them\n",
    "- Understand word padding\n",
    "- Implement LSTMs\n",

    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",

    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",

Note that this may influence the NER task, since an upper case in the middle of a sentence may indicate an entity. Furthermore, the sentences in the dataset are already split into tokens, and all tokens, including punctuation, are separated by a whitespace. The punctuations are also labeled.

    "In this section, you will pad the labels. TextVectorization already padded the sentences, so you must ensure that the labels are properly padded as well. This is not a hard task for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tensorflow has built-in functions for padding\n",
    "1. Padding will be performed uniformly per dataset (train, validation and test) using the maximum sentence length in each dataset and the size of each sentence is exactly the same as the size of their respective labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will pad the vectorized labels with the value -1. You will not use 0 to simplify loss masking and evaluation in further steps. This is because to properly classify one token, a log softmax transformation will be performed and the index with greater value will be the index label. Since index starts at 0, it is better to keep the label 0 as a valid index, even though it is possible to also use 0 as a mask value for labels, but it would require some tweaks in the model architecture or in the loss computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow provides the function [`tf.keras.utils.pad_sequences`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/pad_sequences). The arguments you will need are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sequences`: An array with the labels.\n",
    "- `padding`: The position where padding will take place, the standard is `pre`, meaning the sequences will be padded at the beginning. You need to pass the argument `post`.\n",
    "- `value`: Padding value. The default value is  0."
